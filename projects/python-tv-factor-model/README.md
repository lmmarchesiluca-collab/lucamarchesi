Time-varying factor loadings estimated using Python.

The project explores local kernel estimation techniques
to track the evolution of latent factor structures in time series data.

# Time-Varying Factor Loadings (Python)

This project implements a time-varying factor model estimated using Python.
The focus is on tracking the evolution of latent factor structures in
macro-financial time series through local kernel-based estimation techniques.

## Project overview

The repository contains an empirical pipeline for estimating a linear
Time-Varying Factor Model applied to euro-area macro-financial data.
The codebase is designed to be modular, transparent, and reproducible.

The project is organized into two main components:
- `empirics/`: main scripts that run the empirical analysis
- `tools_empirics/`: modular functions and utilities called by the main scripts

All results (estimates, diagnostics, and figures) are generated by scripts in
`empirics/`, while computational routines are handled by `tools_empirics/`.

## Folder structure
code/
empirics/ – Main scripts for the empirical analysis
main.py – Central driver script
(additional experiments);
tools_empirics/ – Modular functions and utilities
estimation.py – Static and time-varying factor estimation
kernels.py – Kernel functions and bandwidth handling
alignment.py – Procrustes alignment of factor spaces
factors_ic.py – Bai & Ng (2002) information criteria
factors_abc.py – Alessi–Barigozzi–Capasso criterion
hyptest_by_wang.py – Tests for time variation (Su & Wang, 2017)
oos.py – One-sided out-of-sample evaluation
plotting.py – Centralized plotting routines
io_utils.py – Data loading and preprocessing utilities
utils2.py – Miscellaneous helper functions;
data/ – Raw or processed datasets;
figures/ – Automatically generated figures


## Running the pipeline

1. Open `empirics/main.py`
2. Run:python empirics/main.py
3. All results and figures are generated automatically and saved in `figures/`.

## Notes

- Figures are saved automatically by the plotting routines.
- Factor number selection can be toggled between ABC and IC criteria.
- Intermediate results may be cached to avoid recomputation.
- The code is fully modular and individual components can be imported
independently for testing or exploratory analysis.
