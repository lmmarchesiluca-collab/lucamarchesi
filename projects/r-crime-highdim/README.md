Statistical analysis of crime data using R.

Applies statistical methods for high-dimensional data
to a crime dataset.

This repository contains a comprehensive statistical study of urban crime patterns using a dataset of 46 U.S. cities. The analysis aims to uncover the structural and institutional conditions that influence crime.

Key Methodologies:
-Dimensionality Reduction: Applied PCA and Factor Analysis to extract meaningful components, finding that urban security infrastructure and population concentration form a primary structural dimension.

-Clustering: Employed Ward’s Method and K-means to partition cities into homogeneous groups, revealing a clear bifurcation between high-density, institutionally equipped municipalities and less urbanized areas.

Key Finding: The study highlights that crime rates often evolve independently of shared latent structures like density or wealth, suggesting that crime may be driven by more idiosyncratic or context-specific factors.
